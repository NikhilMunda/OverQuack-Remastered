## ü´° Acknowledgments

This is the REMASTERED version of [VexilonHacker/OverQuack](https://github.com/VexilonHacker/OverQuack) and some [dbisu/pico-ducky](https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky). I liked their work and project so much that I thought on tweaking and fixing the Codes. I love Raspberry Pico W üíï how well it worked with OverQuack code.

Proper key state management

## ‚úÖ Script Control Features

üîÅ REPEAT

You can repeat specific lines multiple times using the REPEAT command.

‚úÖ Basic example 1:
```
PRINT "hello world"
REPEAT LINES=1 TIMES=3
```
Result:

```
"hello world"
"hello world"
"hello world"
```

‚úÖ Basic example 2:
```
PRINT "PEACE"         //2nd line
PRINT "hello world"  //1st line
REPEAT LINES=2 TIMES=3
```
Result:

```
"PEACE"
"hello world"
//It reapeated from 2nd line 3 times
"PEACE"     
"hello world"
"PEACE"
"hello world"
"PEACE"
"hello world"
```

## üì¶ Quick Start
Clone the repo:

shell
git clone https://github.com/NikhilMunda/OverQuack-Remastered.git


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration:

Edit config.json for board settings, Wi-Fi/AP, payloads, and pins which can be found inside \OverQuack_src\

```
{
    "DEFAULT_PAYLOAD" :  "payload.oqs",
    "BOARD" : {
        "controll_mode_pin": 5,
        "desc_controll_mode_pin" : "Setting GPIO pin that will change from keystroke mode to storage mode as example pin 2, 6, 10, 13...",

        "enable_auto_switch_mode" : true,
        "desc_enable_auto_switch_mode" : "switch attack mode without  need to replug usb",

        "enable_auto_reload" : false,
        "desc_enable_auto_reload" : "when editing a file in PICO and saving it, it will auto reboot PICO"
    },
    "AP" : {
        "ssid": "WIFI-QUACK",
        "password": "passw1234",
        "channel": "RANDOM",
        "desc_channel" : "You can set random channel  value by using RANDOM or specify channel value as int in range [1,13]",
        "ip_address": "10.10.5.1",
        "ports": [80, 8000, 8080],
        "desc_ports" : "at least you should put 2 ports, other ports are used in emergency"
    }
}
```

## üì± setup it manually

1) Download repo: [HERE](https://github.com/NikhilMunda/OverQuack-Remastered/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

2) Plug your Pico into USB while holding the BOOTSEL button for 3 seconds, then release it. It will show up as "RPI-RP2".

3) Copy OverQuack_installation/firmwares/flash_nuke.uf2 to the RPI-RP2 drive and wait for the Pico to finish rebooting.

4) Copy OverQuack_installation/firmwares/adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_<YOUR_PICO_MODULE>-en_US-9.2.9.uf2 to the RPI-RP2 drive and wait for the Pico to finish rebooting and it going to show up as "CIRCUITPY".

<details>
  <summary>Available firmwares</summary>

‚ö†Ô∏èNOTE: If you want, you can edit/config the file before going to the next step else you will not be able to edit/config later.

‚ö†Ô∏èNOTE: If you want, you can remove/delete the extra keyboad layouts from OverQuack_src\lib\ Keyboard_layouts and keycodes, which doesnot seems neccesarry according to your preference.

5) copy all content of OverQuack_src to CIRCUITPY

6) Setup complete. OverQuack is ready to use. Proceed with your tasks responsibly.

## üîÑ Toggle mode: Mass Storage ‚áÑ HID Keyboard

Connect a switch between GPIO 5 and GND to switch HID/Mass Storage without replugging

OR You can connect a wire between GPIO 5 and GND to switch HID and remove the wire to switch Mass Storage

![simplified_pico_pinout](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/443b500a-49f5-4912-8235-e995e251129a)

üîÅ No need to unplug the USB or manually replug the device after flipping the switch ‚Äî simply toggle the switch, and OverQuack will automatically reboot into the selected mode.

‚öôÔ∏è Highlights
Advanced Scripting: DuckyScript with variables, logic, comments, blocks, random/gen functions, imports, and more

Keyboard Layouts: US, FR, DE, and more‚Äîeasily extend or create your own

Debug & Development: Serial monitor output, debug messages with PRINT, and importable payload chains

Works Everywhere: Windows, Linux, macOS; wireless on supported hardware

## üñ•Ô∏è Accessing the Serial Monitor

üîß For Linux Users:

You can use picocom to access the serial monitor. Install it using your package manager, then run the following command:
```
while true; do if [ -e /dev/ttyACM0 ]; then picocom -b 9600 /dev/ttyACM0; fi; sleep 1; done
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è This command continuously checks for /dev/ttyACM0 and connects when available.

You'll see ongoing output in the terminal.

PRINT messages are color-coded for easier readability.

This works in both Storage Device Mode and HID Mode.

## ü™ü For Windows Users:

You can use PuTTY to access the serial monitor.

 1. Connect your device via USB.

 2. Open the app (PuTTY or Tera Term).

 3. Choose Serial as the connection type.

 4. Set the COM port (e.g., COM3) and baud rate to 9600.

 5. Start the session to begin viewing output.

üí° Tip: You can find your device's COM port in Device Manager under Ports (COM & LPT).

  CAPSLOCK
END_IF

open_notepad

MOUSE_CLICK LEFT    // Click at position
DELAY 500

WHILE $delay_time > 100
  DELAY $delay_time
  $delay_time = $delay_time - 100
END_WHILE

/*
This is a C-style block comment
Multiple lines can go here
*/

REM_BLOCK
This is a traditional Ducky block comment
Both styles are supported
END_REM
```
üìñ Example 3 Now Suppports Complex Nesting:
```

    DELAY @waqt - 200 
    STRING notepad 
    SHIFT ENTER

    ENTER
    STRINGLN_BLOCK
    Jinki manzil ek hoti hai ... woh raaston par hi toh milte hai
    END_STRINGLN
END_FUNCTION

$A = 35

WHILE $A>0
    IF ($A > 25)
       IF ($A<30)
         STRINGLN $A is LESS THAN 30
       ELSE_IF ($A < 25)
         STRINGLN $A is LESS THAN 20
       ELSE
         BREAK
